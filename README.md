## Welcome to my GitHub Page

This contains Python code related to separable matching with transferable utilities, as analyzed in [my paper with Alfred Galichon](http://bsalanie.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cupids-2020-05-16_paper.pdf).

At this stage, it has code for our Iterative Projection Fitting Procedure (IPFP)  to solve for equilibrium in a [Choo and Siow 2006](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/498585?seq=1) model of bipartite, one-to-one matching with perfectly transferable utility.  My [ipfp_python](http://www.github.com/bsalanie/ipfp_python.git) project has IPFP solvers for several variants of the Choo and Siow model: with or without singles, homoskedastic and heteroskedastic. It also has  code that uses moment matching to estimate the semilinear Choo and Siow model as per Proposition 5 of the Galichon-Salanie paper.

The repository also contains code for  a [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) interactive app that demonstrates the basic model (homoskedastic, with singles). You can try it [here](http://3.131.97.82:8501).
