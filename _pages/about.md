I am a Professor at the [Department of Economics](https://econ.columbia.edu) of Columbia University,  in New York City.

My research fields are in applied microeconomics (insurance; labor; public economics) and in theoretical and applied econometrics.

I have taught microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics at various levels and in various places.

This year I am teaching Econometrics (2nd year PhD), Advanced Microeconomics (Masters) and a senior undergraduate seminar on the economics of climate change.
